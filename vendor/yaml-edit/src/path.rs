//! Path-based access to YAML documents.
//!
//! Provides convenient dot-separated path syntax for accessing nested YAML values
//! like `"server.host"` or `"database.primary.port"`.
//!
//! Operations:
//! [`try_get_path`](YamlPath::try_get_path),
//! [`try_set_path`](YamlPath::try_set_path),
//! [`try_remove_path`](YamlPath::try_remove_path).
//! The `try_` variants return [`Result<_, PathError>`](PathError) so
//! malformed paths, empty paths, missing keys, and container-type
//! mismatches are visible rather than silently swallowed.
//!
//! The legacy `get_path` / `set_path` / `remove_path` methods still
//! exist as thin wrappers that discard `PathError`; they are deprecated
//! and will emit warnings.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use yaml_edit::{Document, path::YamlPath};
//! use std::str::FromStr;
//!
//! let yaml = Document::from_str("server:\n  host: localhost\n  port: 8080\n").unwrap();
//!
//! // Get nested values
//! let host = yaml.try_get_path("server.host").ok();
//!
//! // Set nested values (creates intermediate mappings)
//! yaml.try_set_path("database.primary.host", "db.example.com").unwrap();
//!
//! // Remove nested values
//! yaml.try_remove_path("server.port").unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # Aliases
//!
//! When a path segment lands on an alias (`*name`), reads resolve it to
//! the anchored value by default, matching
//! [`get_resolved`](crate::anchor_resolution::DocumentResolvedExt::get_resolved)
//! and [`merged`](crate::anchor_resolution::MappingMergedExt::merged):
//!
//! ```
//! use yaml_edit::{Document, path::YamlPath};
//! use std::str::FromStr;
//!
//! let doc = Document::from_str("shared: &shared\n  timeout: 30\nservice: *shared\n").unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(doc.try_get_path("service.timeout").unwrap().to_string(), "30");
//! ```
//!
//! Writes are different: writing through an alias changes the anchored
//! node, and so changes every other alias pointing at it. That is
//! refused by default. Pass an [`AliasPolicy`] to
//! [`try_set_path_with`](YamlPath::try_set_path_with) to choose
//! deliberately between updating the shared anchor
//! ([`Follow`](AliasPolicy::Follow)) and replacing the alias with an
//! independent copy ([`Expand`](AliasPolicy::Expand)).
//!
//! All operations preserve formatting, comments, and whitespace.
